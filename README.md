# Distance-Based Toll Tax System

## Overview

The Distance-Based Toll Tax System is a software-driven solution designed to streamline toll tax collection by leveraging existing infrastructure and user-provided information. It eliminates the need for hardware installations at toll plazas, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative.

## Core Components

### Mobile Application

* **User Interaction:** Users download a dedicated mobile app.

```bash
# Example: Downloading the app (replace with actual download instructions)
curl -O [https://example.com/download/toll-app.apk](https://example.com/download/toll-app.apk)
adb install toll-app.apk
 ```.

Data Collection: The app collects user and vehicle information, such as license plate and vehicle type.
Bash
# Example: Input vehicle data
echo "Enter your license plate: "
read license_plate
echo "Enter your vehicle type: "
read vehicle_type
curl -X POST [https://api.example.com/vehicle-info](https://api.example.com/vehicle-info) -d "license_plate=$license_plate&vehicle_type=$vehicle_type"
 ```.

Payment Integration: Users can link their preferred payment methods.
Bash
# Example: Linking payment method
curl -X POST [https://api.example.com/payment-method](https://api.example.com/payment-method) -d "card_number=1234-5678-9876-5432&expiry=12/25"
 ```.

Functionality: The app facilitates toll payments and provides users with their trip history.
Bash
# Example: Viewing trip history
curl [https://api.example.com/trip-history?user_id=12345](https://api.example.com/trip-history?user_id=12345)
 ```.

Central Server
Data Management: Stores vehicle and user data securely.
Bash
# Example: Storing user data (replace with actual data storage method)
curl -X POST [https://api.example.com/store-data](https://api.example.com/store-data) -d "user_id=12345&vehicle_data=..."
 ```.

GPS Data Processing: Processes GPS data received from smartphones.
Bash
# Example: Processing GPS data (replace with actual processing logic)
gps_data=$(cat gps-log.txt)
echo "GPS Data: $gps_data" | process_gps_data.sh
 ```.

Toll Calculation: Computes the distance traveled and corresponding toll amount.
Bash
# Example: Calculating toll
distance=$1
vehicle_type=<span class="math-inline">2
toll\=</span>(echo "scale=2; $distance * $vehicle_type" | bc)
echo "Toll: $toll"
 ```.

Payment Integration: Integrates with payment gateways for seamless transactions.
Bash
# Example: Processing payment (same as mobile application)
curl -X POST [https://api.example.com/process-payment](https://api.example.com/process-payment) -d "amount=10.00&payment_method=card"
 ```.

User Management: Manages user accounts and payment histories.
Bash
# Example: Managing user account
user_id=$1
echo "Managing user account $user_id"
 ```.

Analytics: Offers data analytics for traffic patterns and revenue optimization.
Bash
# Example: Running data analytics
start_date=$1
end_date=$2
echo "Running analytics from $start_date to $end_date"
 ```.

GPS Data Integration
Location Accuracy: The system uses GPS data to accurately determine vehicle locations.
Bash
# Example: Fetching GPS location (replace with actual location retrieval method)
curl [https://api.example.com/get-location?device_id=98765](https://api.example.com/get-location?device_id=98765)
 ```.

Data Source: GPS data can be obtained through partnerships with telecommunication companies or directly from smartphones.
Bash
# Example: Accessing smartphone GPS data (replace with actual method)
adb shell dumpsys location
 ```.

Toll Road Mapping
Map Creation: Detailed maps of toll roads are created, including specific toll zones.
Bash
# Example: Creating toll road map (replace with actual map creation method)
curl -X POST [https
 ```.
